These are the people that are in charge of you, in one way or another. You should find out who each one of them is.

- **Supervisor**: (possibly together with a co-supervisor) is the person who will overview your research, and who you should go to for any research-related issues.
- **Examiner**: Is the person who will act as your examiner during your PhD; they evaluate your progress and decide if a course you want to attend will count towards your PhD credits, so ask them about that before choosing to join a course.
- **Line Manager**: It is usually the head of your division or the head of your unit (in some divisions). They are responsible for *work* related issues, such as work environment, yearly appraisal meetings to check that you are able to do your job, etc.
- **Director of Studies**: This is the person that manages the courses in your division, and who will distribute the teaching hours for each one.
