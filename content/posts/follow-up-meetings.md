## What are Follow-up Meetings?

TODO

## Scheduling
You should have at least one follow-up meeting every year, the first one being about 6 months after you start working at Chalmers. If things happen that might prevent you from following the plan set in your most recent follow-up meeting, such as sick leave or parental leave, you should schedule a new meeting as soon as possible to discuss what changes are needed.

## Guidelines
The guidelines to follow can be found here: <https://intranet.chalmers.se/en/tools-support/doctoral-studies-support/during-your-doctoral-studies/follow-up-meetings-and-individual-study-plan-and-follow-up-meetings/#individual-study-plan-and-follow-up-meetings-at-computer-science-and-engineering-4> (Note there's a specific section for CSE, make sure to follow the guidelines in that section, not the general one).

### Presentation
One of the things you will find in the guidelines is the requirement for a ~10 minute presentation. As explained there
> The purpose of the presentation is both to help the follow-up group understand better where you are standing in your PhD as well as to give you an opportunity to practice your presentation skills in a friendly environment.
The presentation is not graded in any way, it's only to get everyone in the meeting up to speed with what has happened in your studies during the last year, so don't get too worried about it.
