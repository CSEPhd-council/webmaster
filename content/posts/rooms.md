## Rooms

To find the location of rooms on campus you can go to [Map (online/app)](http://maps.chalmers.se/) or download the Chalmers map app for smartphones. 


## Booking a room
To book a room you need to create an event in the exchange calendar for that room. 

Log in to the Outlook [webmail client](https://webmail.chalmers.se)), go to the **Calendar** tab and click on **new** to create a new event. 

Click on 'Add a location or a room' and then 'Add room' and you will see which rooms are available at the chosen time.
Choose your preferred room (and add any people you'd like to invite to the meeting), you then book the room (and invite the people) by clicking 'Send'.

**procedure to book rooms directly from your calendar app** 
Adding a room to your calendar 'followers' enables you to check the availability of a room and book it directly from your calendar app (e.g. it works smoothly with iCal). 

You can also book the 'corner' rooms on the 5th and 6th floors by writing on the whiteboard on the door of the respective room.

# Virtual room
The 'corner' room on the 4th floor has a wonderful conference equipment, with excellent webcam and good audio. 
To book the equipment (unfortunately as of 2017 it is not possible to book the room) you need to: 
1. go to the outlook calendar (after logging in in your email) or your calendar app (when the rooms are added as contact)
2. create a new meeting
3. choose 'EDIT Virtuellt Rum 1' (invite as attendee)
4.  set time, add other attendees and send the email. 

**In the room (local party):** press “wake” (twice), switch the large screen on, click on 'call' meeting virtual room
You can adjust the camera: click on 'move' you will be able to turn and zoom (very useful to show the wihteboard)

**In the browser (remote party):** 
	click on the link which comes with the invitation email (it’s always the same), 
	allow browser to access camera / video. If you use this service a lot, you can download *lifesizecloud* to acces more features.
