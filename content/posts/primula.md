## Report vacations, leave, expenses

Chalmers employees use the 
[Primula](https://personal.portal.chalmers.se/chalmers/) portal to apply for vacation days and leave, report sick days, and apply to be compensated for travel expenses and other expenses. 

You log in with your CID username and password.

Here you can also check how many vacation days you have left (or accumulated), your employment statements and records. 

Do not forget to keep you *Personal Data* page up-to-date (in particular if you move to a new address).
