## Report vacations, leave, expenses

Chalmers employees use the 
[Primula](https://personal.portal.chalmers.se/chalmers/) portal to apply for vacation days and leave, report sick days, and apply to be compensated for travel expenses and other expenses. 

You log in with your CID username and password.

There you can also check how many vacation days you have left (or accumulated), your employment statements and records. 

Do not forget to keep your *Personal Data* page up-to-date (in particular if you move to a new address).

You can find some tips on how to organize a business trip in our [*Traveling as a Chalmers' Employee* page](/posts/travelex) and a proper guide on how to apply for refund of business travel expenses on the right panel in the *Travel Expenses* section. In case of doubts, consult with your supervisor or manager.
