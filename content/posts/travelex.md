## Chalmer's Guidelines

In the following link you can find the official guide from chalmers to book a trip: https://intranet.chalmers.se/en/tools-support/general-support-services/conferences-meetings-business-travel/business-travels/book-a-trip/

This link gives the basic guidelines for what expenses are covered and how you should pay for them and register them: https://intranet.chalmers.se/en/tools-support/general-support-services/conferences-meetings-business-travel/business-travels/expenses-travel-bill-and-entertainment/


## Travel Approval

**Before you go:** Find out cost estimate, check with your supervisor if your project can cover the cost. 
Fill in a [BTA form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdZDN5LPn2lget_3JQWUJImnJMx5TM7WjClmOJmVl2TIcMoyQ/viewform) (*This form might be outdated, ask your division secretary just in case*)
(the form will be sent to your division head for signature and to your division secretary for reference).  
Book the travel using the Chalmers (or GU) travel agent (Lingmerths). 

**Travel:** Enjoy it, pay with your Chalmers MasterCard or in other ways, just remember to keep receipts for any non-food expense (e.g. taxi, train tickets..)

**After:** To be refunded, fill in a travel-expenses claim in [primula](https://personal.portal.chalmers.se/chalmers/) 
within *one month*. Send all your receipts to LRS using one of the large yellow envelopes available in the post-room on the 4th floor, 
cross away the previous addressee and write LRS, close the envelope and leave it on the 'outgoing internal mail' bin.

**Mortal deadline:** after *three months* the claim is no longer payable. 


## How to fill in the report:

- For each meal _M_ on each day there are three options:
    1. Checking box **with meal benefits** (**B**): choose this option if meal _M_ is included as part of another fee (for example, a lunch that is included in a conference registration fee) **and** _M_ is not a breakfast.
    2. Checking box **without meal benefits** (**N**): choose this optin if meal _M_ is offered by a third party (for example, if you are a guest and your host pays for _M_) **or** _M_ is a breakfast (which is usually included in hotel fee)
    3. Not checking either box (**E**): choose this option if you pay for meal _M_ yourself (for example, you go out to a restaurant and pay your share of the bill out of your own pocket) (Don't clicking on anything)

The consequences of these options are:

1. **B** (with meal benefits) implies that you will not get an allowance for meal _M_, but Chalmers paid indirectly (for example through the registration fee) and will pay taxes accordingly.
2. **N** (without meal benefits) implies that you will not get an allowance for meal _M_, and Chalmers did not pay either.
3. **E** (not clicking on anything) implies that you will get an allowance for meal _M_. Note, however, that the allowance is a fixed amount: you do not get reimbursed what you paid exactly (and hence you do not need to keep receipts of meal expenses).
