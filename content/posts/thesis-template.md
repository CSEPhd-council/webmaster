We at the council have a github repository with a LaTeX template for you to use for your Licentiate or PhD thesis.

**You should double-check the requirements for your thesis and that the template matches them.**

If the requirements have been updated, we would appreciate very much if you could send a pull-request to fix the template.

We will welcome any other improvements that you find it needs as pull-requests.

It can be found here: <https://github.com/CSEPhd-council/thesis-template>
