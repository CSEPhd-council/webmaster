### We're looking for a local PhD Ombudsman
### Nominee Deadline : 19th of April 2020

---

This is your chance to improve you fellow PhD student's experience, by listening them and helping
them to look at their problem from a different prospective.Despite there are
[several different](https://www.dokt.chs.chalmers.se/support-for-phd-students/)
contacts that are there to help you, such as the Doktorandombudet (DOMB),
in agreement with the CSE Research School, we re-introduce the figure of the *CSE PhD Ombudsman* as
an elected PhD student that has the role to locally listen and help other PhD students by giving an
objective point of view on difficult and sometimes tedious PhD related problems.We want this figure 
to be a local student in order to allow for a more precise idea of the dynamics
in the department and the possible research-culture that are associated with the CS community.

[Here you can find the official statute](/posts/council-docs/ombudsman-statutes) for the CSE PhD Ombudsman.

Some quick points regarding the CSE PhD ombudsman:

- **It's a two year role!**
- **Don't be afraid, you will not be alone!** The Council and the Research School will always be there to guide you in case of any problem.
- **If you are unable to be impartial,** just forward people to the central DOMB
- **You will have to write a yearly summary** that anonymously explains the type of problems discussed and/or useful statistic to be considered when discussing PhD working environment.
- **You will get departmental duties** for the task. The Research School has agreed for it to be at least the amount of hours received by a council's member in one year *(~50 hours)*.

If you are up to the task, or you know someone that might be perfect for the role, please send an email with your nominee or self-nominee to **phdcouncil.cse [at] chalmers.se**.
