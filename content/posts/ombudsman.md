### CSE PhD Ombudsman: Matthías Páll Gissurarson (pallm [at] chalmers [dot] se)

Matthías was elected in during May of 2020.


### About the Ombudsman Role

[Here you can find the official statute](/posts/council-docs/ombudsman-statutes) for the CSE PhD Ombudsman.


Despite there being __[several different](https://www.dokt.chs.chalmers.se/support-for-phd-students/)__ contacts
that are there to help you, such as the Doktorandombud (DOMB), in agreement with the CSE Research School we
re-introduce the position of the CSE PhD Ombudsman as an elected PhD student that has the local role to listen
and help other PhD students by giving an objective point of view on difficult, or sometimes tedious, PhD related
problems. In order to provide a more precise idea of the dynamics in the department and the possible research-culture
that are associated with the CS community, this role is served by a PhD student at the department.

Some quick points regarding the CSE PhD ombudsman:

- This role is there to give easier *local* access to someone who can **listen and help other PhD students** by providing an objective point of view on **doctorand-related problems**.
- It’s a **two year** position, **elected by the PhD students** of the CSE department.
- If they are **unable to be impartial** or provide the kind of help needed, issues will be forwarded to the **central DOMB**.
- They will write a **yearly summary** of their work that **anonymously explains the type of problems discussed** and/or useful statistic to be considered when discussing PhD working environment.
