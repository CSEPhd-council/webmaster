As a Chalmers PhD student you have the right <u>**and the obligation**</u> to be part of the Chalmers Student Union. 
Sign up for the [Student Union](http://medlem.chs.chalmers.se), this automatically gives you 3 months in the SGS queue 
and gives you access to all student discounts [Mecenat](https://mecenat.com/se/). 
You can use your Student Union card to buy discounted food at campus restaurants.
The fee is **190 SEK** every semester.

If you were already a Chalmers student before becoming a PhD student, you should contact the student union to make sure your section fee goes to [DS](https://www.dokt.chs.chalmers.se/) rather than your previous student section.

**A student union card is REQUIRED for taking an exam**

! **IMPORTANT:** If you are a Chalmers PhD student, in order to graduate you need to prove you have payed the fee to the Student Union for all the semesters you have worked at Chalmers.
