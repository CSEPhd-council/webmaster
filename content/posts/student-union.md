## The Student Union / Doctorand Students Guild (DS)

As a Chalmers PhD student you have the right <u>**and the obligation**</u> to be part of the Chalmers Student Union. 
Sign up for the [Student Union](http://medlem.chs.chalmers.se), this automatically gives you 3 months in the SGS queue 
and gives you access to all student discounts [Mecenat](https://mecenat.com/se/). 
You can use your Student Union card to buy discounted food at campus restaurants.
The fee is **190 SEK** every semester.

If you were already a Chalmers student before becoming a PhD student, you should contact the student union to make sure your section fee goes to [DS](https://www.dokt.chs.chalmers.se/) rather than your previous student section.

**A student union card is REQUIRED for taking an exam**

! **IMPORTANT:** If you are a Chalmers PhD student, in order to graduate you need to prove you have payed the fee to the Student Union for all the semesters you have worked at Chalmers. 

### Mecenat

The [Mecenat](https://mecenat.com/se/om-mecenat/vara-kort) card gives you access to more student discounts (than just the DS card). Very useful, keep track of sales with the app!
(Apple, Swebus, Comviq, Tele2, Tre, SF Cinema, Adlibris, ...)
