This activity plan outlines the items and issues which the council plans to work on during its term in 2019-2020. This is a high-level, strategic plan of activities.


## PhD students Representation

### Background
Representation of PhD students in various department committees, such as the department council or research education committee such as DS, SWEET, PhD Mingle, etc. 

### Action
We plan to properly represent the PhD students in these different committees and report back the results.


## Webpage and PR

### Background
In the past, the PhD Council was mostly responsible for seminars and social activities. This interpretation of the council’s responsibilities has now broadened to include PhD student representation towards the department and representing the department towards the PhD students,  which necessitates a larger council.

### Action
We aim to update information and build a common information hub for all the PhD students.


## Newcomer Welcome Processes + Buddy System

### Background
The processes for welcoming new PhD students differ greatly within the department. In 2017, a “welcome package” and process was introduced by the PhD council and, together, the “buddy system”. Now, every new PhD student receives a “welcome package” and a buddy.

### Action
We aim to continue in the welcome process and we aim to collect statistics and verify the process in order to check if it is useful, it is maintained and if there are possibilities to improve.

*Update “welcome package”, make sure that papers given to newcomers are up to date, informative, relevant. Can we get information about incoming students sooner?*


## PhD Courses

### Background
There is a relatively small number of PhD courses available in the department, and information regarding PhD courses is not always clear. For instance, who is responsible for approving a PhD course, who is responsible for finding the relevant paperwork, and where does one find it? It is also not clear where the funding for PhD courses comes from, and this is often cited as one of the reasons why professors are reluctant to give PhD courses.

### Action
We aim to work on improving all aspects related to PhD education, and in particular issues related to PhD courses and surrounding procedures. This includes collecting and clarifying information related to the PhD education (for instance self-study courses and credits for paper reviews).


## Study Plan + Follow-up Meetings

### Background
The follow-up meeting is a key-important meeting during the PhD. Different opinions are yet to be discussed in order to check if the students find out if  the current structure of the meeting, and/or the Individual Study Plan, is good or can be improved by just changing it/them.

### Action
We aim to further investigate via survey/interviews the phd students in order to obtain some data in order to start our investigations and, if possible, to test some different meeting structure and/or the ISP.


## Seminars

### Background
In the past, the organisation of seminars which are of general interest to PhD students at the CSE department has been a core task of the PhD council. 

### Action
We aim to continue to organise seminars of broad interest. For example on topics such as stress identification and management, or information about services available to PhD students. 


## Social activities

### Background
In the past, organising social activities for all PhD students at the CSE department has been a core activity of the council. Examples of past activities are laser tag, bowling and  board game evenings. 

### Action
We aim to organise regular social activities in order to strengthen the social cohesion in the CSE department.
