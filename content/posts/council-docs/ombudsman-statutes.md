## Statutes of the Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) PhD student Ombudsman

### Section 1: General principles

1. The Computer Science and Engineering PhD student Ombudsman (hereafter referred to as “the PhD ombudsman”) is an official role held by a PhD student, nominated and elected by the doctoral students at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) and approved by the CSE department and/or the graduate school.

2. The role of the PhD ombudsman is to help PhD students who experience difficulties during the course of their PhD, by providing counsel and acting as a neutral intermediary. The ombudsman is bound to confidentiality, and will only take action with the approval of the student concerned. The services of the ombudsman are available to all PhD students in the department. 

3. Any doctoral student enrolled at one of the graduate schools of the department at the time of the election is eligible as PhD ombudsman.

4. The PhD ombudsman is a two year role from the date of election result publication.

5. After being elected, the graduate school and the current PhD council will provide the PhD ombudsman with “bootstrap documentation” to guide them in their new role.

6. On a yearly basis, the PhD ombudsman should release an anonymised summary of the topics PhD students have come to discuss with them, with the primary goal of facilitating the awareness and discussion of delicate topics. The PhD council and the department/graduate school must act as filters in order to verify the anonymity and confidentiality of the document.


### Section 2: Election Procedure

1. The current elected PhD council is responsible for organising the nomination phase.

2. Nominations for the PhD Ombudsman can be made by anyone prior to the election. Self-nominations are allowed.

3. The nomination phase must be at least 10 working days long.

4. The nominees list must then be approved by the department/research school.

5. The PhD ombudsman is elected by electronic vote (see Section 3).


### Section 3: Electronic voting rules

1. The currently elected council is responsible for organising the electronic voting. 

2. An electronic vote has to be announced at least 10 working days in advance, and it must be held open for at least 10 working days. 

3. Each doctoral student enrolled at one of the graduate schools of the department is invited personally via email. The voting system has to have support for personalized votes to prevent multiple votes by the same person. Each doctoral student enrolled at one of the graduate schools of the department has one vote.

4. For each nominee, voting options are “yes”, to vote for the nominee, and “no”, to vote against the nominee.

5. For an electronic vote to be valid, the number of participants in the vote must be at least 20 doctoral students enrolled at any of the graduate schools of the department. If the total number of enrolled doctoral students is less than 20, at least 20% of them must participate for the vote to be valid. 

6. If no candidate has at least 50% positive votes out of the total number of votes, the process has to be repeated. Otherwise, the candidate with the most positive votes is elected.

7. In case of a tie for the highest number of positive votes, the CSE department and/or the graduate school administration will decide which of the most voted candidates will be chosen as PhD ombudsman.
