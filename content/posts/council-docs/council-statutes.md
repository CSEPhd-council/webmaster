# Statutes of the Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) PhD Student Council

Last update: 2018-05-09

## Section 1: General principles

1. The Computer Science and Engineering PhD Student Council (hereafter referred to as “the council”) is a group of representatives for the doctoral students at the combined Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at Chalmers University of Technology and Gothenburg University (hereafter referred to as “the department”).
2. The name of the council is “The Computer Science and Engineering PhD Student Council”.
3. The purpose of the council is to:
    1. Represent the doctoral students towards the department. This implies that representatives in reference groups should be chosen from the council members. The council has the right to delegate these tasks. 
    2. Promote the common interests of doctoral students at the department, and to facilitate good relations among the students, and between the students and the department as a whole.
    3. Serve as a link to the doctoral guilds / doctoral sections (DS) of the student unions at Chalmers and Gothenburg University (GU).
    4. Give, within reason, direction and support to doctoral students at the department with issues related to their academic experience.
    5. Distribute useful information to doctoral students at the department. 
3. The activities of the council are controlled by the regulations contained within this document.
4. The council’s highest decision-making body is the electronic vote (see section 4).
5. Changes to these statutes must be approved by two consecutive electronic votes, with at least 3 months in between the two votes.



## Section 2: Workings of the council

1. The council is elected by electronic vote (see section 4).
2. The term of the council is limited to one year, or until a new council is elected, whichever occurs first.
3. If no new council is elected until the end of the term, the council will remain active “pro-forma” without formal obligations. However, the council should strive to find a new council as soon as possible. If no new council is elected until all council members left the department, any doctoral student at the department may call for an electronic vote to vote on a new council. In that case, the student who called for the vote will organise the vote; otherwise, the regulations outlined in this document apply to that vote. 
4. Council meetings are announced, together with a preliminary agenda, via email by the chair of the council to all council members, and to the student guild representatives (Chalmers and Gothenburg University) of the department. The announcement should be sent at least seven calendar days in advance.
5. The council should strive to make consensus-based decisions. If consensus cannot be reached, an open vote is held where each council member has one vote. In case of a tie, the chair of the council has the deciding vote.
6. Minutes have to be taken during the council meetings. The minutes must include the agenda points discussed, important outcomes of the discussions and the decisions that were made. 
7. The council reports on their activities via email when appropriate (e.g., due to important ongoing work of immediate or near-term effect). The council must also summarise their activities at least once towards the end of their term. 



## Section 3: Roles and members of the council

1. Any doctoral student enrolled at one of the graduate schools of the department at the time of the election is eligible as council member. 
2. The council should consist of one representative from each division at the department. If no representative can be found for a particular division, the vacant seat may be given to a representative of another division. 
3. The council must consist of at least a chair and a vice-chair, so a minimum of two members is required to form a council. 
4. At the first council meeting after the council has been elected, the council elects a chair and a vice-chair. For a newly elected council, the council decides together on the time and date of the first meeting (since the new chair has not been chosen yet).
5. The chair may temporarily delegate their responsibilities to the vice chair. 
6. If a council member resigns before their term ends, the council may replace the resigning member in a by-election with a new member who serves until the end of the term.
7. Council elections must be announced to all doctoral students and every eligible candidate should have the possibility to apply. The elections are to be held electronically, as regulated by this document (see section 4). 
8. The CSE student guild representatives, if active, are not automatically part of the council. However, they may attend council meetings.
9. The local ombudsman, if active, is not part of the council. However, they may attend council meetings.



## Section 4: Electronic voting and council election
1. An electronic vote is held at least once per year in order to elect the council for the next term, and when deemed necessary to make far reaching decisions, for instance to change these statutes. 
2. The currently elected council is responsible for organising the electronic votes. 
3. An electronic vote has to be announced at least 10 working days in advance, and it must be held open for at least 10 working days. 
4. Nominations for members of the council can be made by anyone prior to the election (see section 3). Self-nominations are allowed.
5. Each doctoral student enrolled at one of the graduate schools of the department is invited personally via email. The voting system has to have support for personalized votes to prevent multiple votes by the same person.
6. For each nominee, voting options are “yes”, to vote for the nominee’s inclusion in the council, and “no”, to vote against the nominee’s inclusion in the council.
7. For an electronic vote to be valid, the number of participants in the vote must be at least 20 doctoral students enrolled at one of the graduate schools of the department. If the total number of enrolled doctoral students is less than 20, at least 20% of them must participate for the vote to be valid. 
8. A candidate who receives over 50% of the votes is elected. If less than two candidates receive over 50% of the votes, no new council is elected and the vote has to be repeated.
9. If there is more than one candidate for a seat, and at least one of the candidates receives over 50% of the votes, the candidate with more votes wins the seat. 
10. Each doctoral student enrolled at one of the graduate schools of the department has one vote.
11. For changes to these statutes a two-thirds majority is required.
