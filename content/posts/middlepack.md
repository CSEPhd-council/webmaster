## Travel Approval

**Before you go:** Find out cost estimate, check with your supervisor if your project can cover the cost. 
Fill in the new [e-form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdZDN5LPn2lget_3JQWUJImnJMx5TM7WjClmOJmVl2TIcMoyQ/viewform) 
(the form will be sent to your line manager for signature and to your division secretary for reference).  
Book the travel using the Chalmers (or GU) travel agent ([egencia](https://idp.chalmers.se/adfs/ls/?SAMLRequest=hZHNbsIwEIRfxfI9cf5KwCJBtKgqElURhB56qRzHBkuJnWYd6OPXAiLBhR5XnvHMfjud%2FTY1OooOlNEZDv0AI6G5qZTeZ3hXvHpjPMunwJo6aum8twe9ET%2B9AIucUQO9vGS47zQ1DBRQzRoB1HK6nb%2BvaOQHtO2MNdzUGM0BRGdd1IvR0Dei24ruqLjYbVYZPljbAiXkdDr5Yu9aKOZz0xDmUskxJMw5JeN28GK0cD2UZvbcfbCrqvX5gdVOAT4IwioJpAaC0XKR4e%2BEJ6kUcTouR2WVBDJOJzKNZcWCciTLUDoZQC%2BWGizTNsNREKZeGHpRUoQxfZrQJPEnUfqF0fq61rPSF1yPGJQXEdC3olh7649tgdHngN0J8BUyPad3t3Qff8wGpDj%2FB%2BCU3Cbk1%2FH%2Bqvkf&RelayState=Y2FsbEJhY2tVUkw6PTphSFIwY0hNNkx5OTNkM2N1WldkbGJtTnBZUzV6WlM5aGNIQS9jMlZ5ZG1salpUMWxlSFJsY201aGJDWndZV2RsUFV4dloybHVKbTF2WkdVOVptOXliU1p0WVhKclpYUTlVMFU9X3xfY29tcGFueUlkOj06QUg0aDZEREhUUjRTSzhJRkdPZVkwUV98X3NvdXJjZTo9OlJWVT1ffF92YW5pdHlVcmw6PTpvRTVqcWE3djJCUTBKLTJZOXFNTTk5VVFTemJJdEtyTy15ZVNmQ2dQUVN3)). 

**Travel:** Enjoy it, pay with your Chalmers MasterCard or in other ways, just remember to keep receipts for any non-food expense (e.g. taxi, train tickets..)

**After:** To be refunded, fill in a travel-expenses claim in [primula](https://personal.portal.chalmers.se/chalmers/) 
within *one month*. Send all your receipts to LRS using one of the large yellow folders available in the post-room on the 4th floor, 
cross away the previous addressee and write LRS, close the folder and leave it on the 'outgoing internal mail' pile.
See how to fill in the report [here]. 

**Mortal deadline:** after *three months* the claim is no longer payable. 


## Expense report and Vacation
[Primula](https://personal.portal.chalmers.se/chalmers/)
[TODO] Procedure of filing expense report (including LRS) 

### How to select meal benefits ###

- For each meal _M_ on each day there are three options:
    1. Checking box **with meal benefits** (**B**): choose this option if meal _M_ is included as part of another fee (for example, a lunch that is included in a conference registration fee) **and** _M_ is not a breakfast.
    2. Checking box **without meal benefits** (**N**): choose this optin if meal _M_ is offered by a third party (for example, if you are a guest and your host pays for _M_) **or** _M_ is a breakfast (which is usually included in hotel fee)
    3. Not checking either box (**E**): choose this option if you pay for meal _M_ yourself (for example, you go out to a restaurant and pay your share of the bill out of your own pocket) (Don't clicking on anything)

The consequences of these options are:

1. **B** (with meal benefits) implies that you will not get an allowance for meal _M_, but Chalmers paid indirectly (for example through the registration fee) and will pay taxes accordingly.
2. **N** (without meal benefits) implies that you will not get an allowance for meal _M_, and Chalmers did not pay either.
3. **E** (not clicking on anything) implies that you will get an allowance for meal _M_. Note, however, that the allowance is a fixed amount: you do not get reimbursed what you paid exactly (and hence you do not need to keep receipts of meal expenses).

# Rooms
[Map (online/app)](http://maps.chalmers.se/) To find rooms

## Booking Rooms
** To book a room you need to create and event in the exchange calendar (after loggining to [webmail client](https://webmail.chalmers.se)) and mark the room as an attendee.  **


## Room Availability
In order to have (at least in the outlook-chalmers-webmail UI) the calendar of a Chalmers room:

1. Enter the webmail client and go into the **People** tab
2. Under the **Directory** section, (once opened) you find **Chalmers Room**
3. Add the room that you are interested as contacts (I suggest to have all of them into a list of contacts)
4. In the **Calendar** tab, you now can search the room name (**as a person**) and it will appear (It is important to search "as people" otherwise you just search in your calendar events)



# Student union
[Paying for student uninon card](http://medlem.chs.chalmers.se)
** Student union card is REQUIRED for taking an exam **
While you can delay the payment of student uninon membership fee (meaning that you wouldn't get card as well), it is encouraged to pay the membership fee since the uninon card actually provides you additional benefits such as discounts and so on. 


## Discount (Apple, Swebus, Comviq, Tele2, Tre, SF Cinema, Adlibris, ...)
[Mecent](https://mecenat.com/se/) SJ and vastraffik do have discount with student union card even if you are above 26.
Bus 16 and 55 (Main stations: Chalmers, Chalmers TvÃ¤rgatan - Brunsparken - Lindholem) are also available for 300 SEK (6 months period card)

You can install an app to browse through discounts.

** If you have teaching in Lindholmen you can get this card for free **

```

### Calendar
In Sweden knowing week numbers is really useful (Google calendar support showing week # in the calendar view).
In Ubuntu to show calendar with week numbers (or set it in "time & calendar" indicator) :
```
gsettings set org.gnome.shell.calendar show-weekdate true
```

# Swedish
[Folkuniversitetet](http://www.folkuniversitetet.se/chalmers) Only basic courses are free

[GU - Swedish language and culture](http://uf.gu.se/english/ask/staff/language-courses/?languageId=100001) course for international staff, guest researchers and PhD students

# Union
[Akademikernas a-kassa](https://www.aea.se/) at least 12 months before graduation.

[Why](https://www.thelocal.se/20160921/7-reasons-you-should-join-swedens-a-kassa-akadermikernas-akassa-tlccu)

# Fire

For each iteration of a course (using Fire) a new Fire instance is needed. To create a new Fire instance mail Evgeny Kotelnikov and provide:

 - The course name
 - All course codes (courses given at both Chalmers and GU has at least two)

For each new instance you need to add the actual labs. Note the difference between "group labs" and "individual labs".

Then you need to add graders under the "Graders" tab. Make sure that the grading workload (the lower table) is filled out correctly (otherwise students will not be able to submit assignments).

Some things are not possible to do using the UI, such as removing labs. For this you need to mail Evgeny.

## Working remotely via SSH servers

VPN, SSH can be used to work remotely while keeping your access to chalmers resources, restricted articles and libraries.

[self-administered](https://student.portal.chalmers.se/en/contactservice/ITServices/self-administered/Sidor/default.aspx)

- ssh CID@remote12.chalmers.se
- ssh CID@remote2.student.chalmers.se
- ssh CID@remote11.chalmers.se

If you do not want to reenter your password all the time, add
the following two lines to the corresponding entries in `$HOME/.ssh/config`:

~~~~
     GSSAPIAuthentication yes
     GSSAPIDelegateCredentials yes
~~~~

After that, having a valid Kerberos ticket will suffice to log in.

A more lightweight solution is to use sshuttle (https://github.com/apenwarr/sshuttle).
Running the following command will automatically tunnel all TCP connections and
DNS requests through the chalmers network:
~~~~
sshuttle -r remote11.chalmers.se 0/0
~~~~


# Printer
[Web interface to printers](https://print.chalmers.se/auth/uploadme.cgi)
You can use web interface to see nearby printers, download drivers or directly send pdf, txt files to be printed.

## Ubuntu installation (tested on 14.x, 12.x)
[Download Drivers](http://print.chalmers.se/drivers/)

- in "system-config-printer" type  smb://print.chalmers.se/cse-ed-5473-laser1 (or your printer address)
- add corresponding driver file (*.PDD). It fails to authenticate first, but you can set the password here when you look at printer queue.
- username: NET/CID

## Printing via ipp/kerberos:
Copy `krb5.conf` in this repository to `/etc/krb5.conf` and
run:
~~~~
test -d $HOME/.cups || mkdir $HOME/.cups
cat <<EOF >$HOME/.cups/client.conf
ServerName print.chalmers.se
GSSServiceName HTTP
EOF
~~~~
In older versions of CUPS, you may have to add those lines to the system-wide configuration file in `/etc/cups/client.conf`.
Then, printing should work whenever you have a valid Kerberos ticket that
can be obtained by running `kinit $YOUR_CID`
