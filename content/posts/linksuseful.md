# Some useful links

[//]: # (TODO: Find the proper link in the intranet instead of insidan. I couldn't find it now :S)

[Unofficial PhD Student Guide by DS](https://www.notion.so/Unofficial-PhD-Student-Guide-370f7fdc63ef42c8bbfd1bc9b1bb878e)

[Roles and Responsabilities](https://intranet.chalmers.se/en/about-chalmers/organisation/doctoral-studies/roles-and-responsibilities-in-doctoral-studies/)

[Intranet](https://intranet.chalmers.se/en/) Here you might be able to find most of the information you might need about anything in the PhD. The drawbacks are there's also a lot of information that might not be relevant to you so things are sometimes difficult to find. Requires login.


[Welcome leaflet](http://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/cse/uploads/PhDStudents/welcome_leaflet.pdf) with a bunch of useful organizational information (also for non-PhDs)

[Licentiate degree](https://intranet.chalmers.se/en/tools-support/doctoral-studies-support/licentiate/preparations-for-licentiate-seminars/?#prepare-for-your-licentiate-seminar-at-computer-science-and-engineering) (There are rules specific to CSE, make sure to follow those in addition to the basic ones described in the same page)

[Follow-up meetings](https://intranet.chalmers.se/en/tools-support/doctoral-studies-support/during-your-doctoral-studies/follow-up-meetings-and-individual-study-plan-and-follow-up-meetings/#individual-study-plan-and-follow-up-meetings-at-computer-science-and-engineering-4)
