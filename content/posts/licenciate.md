About halfway through your PhD studies at Chalmers you are required to defend your Licentiate thesis. This is a formal presentation with your examiner and an external opponent, where you should present the work you have done up to that moment.

The following document has information on how to prepare for the seminar. Note there's specific guidelines for CSE, make sure to adhere to those too: <https://intranet.chalmers.se/en/tools-support/doctoral-studies-support/licentiate/preparations-for-licentiate-seminars/>

If you are a Chalmers student, to be eligible for the Licentiate degree you are required to have completed a series of credits, some of which need to be from specific GTS courses. You can find more information on the required GTS courses here: <https://intranet.chalmers.se/en/tools-support/doctoral-studies-support/courses/courses-and-activities-within-gts/>

The thesis should follow the guidelines given, which can be found at <https://intranet.chalmers.se/en/tools-support/doctoral-studies-support/licentiate/layout-and-printing-of-licentiate-thesis/>
